# TheReactionGame

*TheReactionGame* is a project based on the realization of a reflex meter with a communication through a serial interface between the *NUCLEO F4102RE* board and a generic computer.
Specificly the game is based on measurement of the time that the player spends to push a button on the board, after the power on/off of a board integrated LED which changes its state with a random time between 10 and 20 seconds.

a) GUI (developed in Python)
b) shell interface. 

The first screen in which it is possible to choose the interface is the following one:
